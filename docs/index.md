Zeus is a C++ utility library that was born from the core modules shared across
my three other projects: Atlas, Apollo, and Hermes. Since the modules are
virtually identical and updates are generally shared across projects, it made
updating them tedious. By separating them into their own project, these
utilities can now be shared across multiple projects and simplify updating. In
order to simplify and streamline dependencies, Zeus is shipped as a header-only
library.
